Task 21: Audit #[allow(dead_code)] in src/memory/

=== BEFORE COUNT ===
19 dead_code occurrences across 6 files (original HEAD before commit 4a75007)

=== AFTER COUNT ===
20 dead_code suppressions across 6 files
(+2 new for ParsedMarkdownLine.layer/provenance fields exposed by removing parse_markdown_entry_metadata,
 -1 removed: parse_markdown_entry_metadata function deleted = net +1)

=== CHANGES MADE ===
1. REMOVED (genuinely unused):
   - markdown.rs: parse_markdown_entry_metadata() — never called anywhere

2. ADDED (exposed by removal):
   - markdown.rs: #[allow(dead_code)] on ParsedMarkdownLine.layer — populated during [md:...] tag parsing
   - markdown.rs: #[allow(dead_code)] on ParsedMarkdownLine.provenance — same

3. KEPT WITH COMMENTS (18 suppressions):
   - sqlite/mod.rs: db_path (diagnostics/reconnection), vector_weight/keyword_weight (projection search layer)
   - sqlite/mod.rs: reindex() — public maintenance API
   - sqlite/codec.rs: category_to_str, str_to_category — used by dormant projection layer
   - sqlite/search.rs: fts5_search, vector_search — used by dormant projection search
   - sqlite/repository.rs: 8 projection methods — full-stack search API not yet wired to Memory trait
   - markdown.rs: list_projection_entries — used by unit tests
   - lancedb/mod.rs: ProjectionEntry.category — set during deserialization, read in tests

=== VERIFICATION ===
- cargo test --test memory: 64 passed, 0 failed
- cargo check --features "vector-search": OK (with 1 unrelated warning)
- cargo clippy -- -D warnings: CLEAN

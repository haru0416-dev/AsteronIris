============================================================

Standard Gate:
  fmt:     FAIL — 3 formatting diffs (lancedb/mod.rs, markdown.rs, sqlite/codec.rs)
  clippy:  FAIL — dead_code error: fields `layer` and `provenance` never read in ParsedMarkdownLine (src/memory/markdown.rs:26)
  test:    PASS (2256 passed, 0 failed, 1 ignored [inventory_scope_lock — known pre-existing])

Feature Matrix Gate:
  no-default-features:          PASS (with 1 dead_code warning)
  email,vector-search,tui,media: PASS (with 1 dead_code warning)
  lib:                          PASS (with 1 dead_code warning)
  bin:                          PASS (with 1 dead_code warning)

Security Regression Gate:
  action_intent:    PASS (2 tests)
  external_content: PASS (2 tests)
  gateway:          PASS (9 tests)
  injection_guard:  PASS (1 test)
  governance:       PASS (5 tests)
  revocation_gate:  PASS (3 tests)
  tenant_recall:    PASS (6 tests)

============================================================
VERDICT: FAIL
============================================================

Root Causes (2 issues):
1. cargo fmt: 3 files have formatting diffs
   - src/memory/lancedb/mod.rs:72 — inline comment needs line break
   - src/memory/markdown.rs:289 — extra blank line
   - src/memory/sqlite/codec.rs:16 — comment indentation

2. cargo clippy -D warnings: dead_code error
   - src/memory/markdown.rs:26 — fields `layer` and `provenance` in
     struct ParsedMarkdownLine are never read

Note: All 4 cargo check variants pass (exit 0) despite the dead_code
warning because `cargo check` does not use `-D warnings`. The clippy
invocation promotes warnings to errors, causing the failure.

# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with
code in this repository.

**All coding guidance lives in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).**
That file covers commands, architecture, code style, test structure, security
invariants, and commit conventions. It is the single source of truth for any
AI coding agent operating in this repository — including Claude Code.
